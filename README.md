# Intelligent Assistant for Mental Well-Being

A personalized, AI-driven assistant that analyzes emotional states and recommends mental-wellness activities, helping users manage stress, anxiety, and emotional well-being.

# About

The Intelligent Assistant for Mental Well-Being is a smart web-based platform designed to support users in understanding and improving their emotional health. The system analyzes user-expressed thoughts and quick mood inputs using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and provides personalized wellness activities such as breathing exercises, guided meditations, affirmations, and mindfulness breaks.

Traditional mental-health self-care often lacks personalization and continuity. This project addresses that gap by automatically assessing emotional states, recommending suitable activities, tracking progress over time, and visualizing mood trends—helping users build healthy emotional habits with minimal effort.

# System Architecture

The Intelligent Assistant for Mental Well-Being follows a client–server architecture.
The frontend is developed using React and Vite, providing mood selection, text input, activity recommendations, and audio playback.
The backend is implemented using Express.js, where sentiment analysis and rule-based mood prioritization are performed.
Mood logs are stored and later visualized in a dashboard to track emotional trends and activity usage.
The system ensures personalized recommendations by prioritizing user-selected mood over textual sentiment analysis.
